This repository contains an example of a common logical error in Ada code. The `Check_Range` function is intended to check if an integer is within the range of 10 to 20, inclusive. However, due to a flaw in the function's logic, it will always return `False`, even for numbers that are actually within the specified range.  The `Example` procedure demonstrates the incorrect behaviour.  The solution file provides a corrected version of the `Check_Range` function.
